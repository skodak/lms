  moodle/cohort:assign capability in cohort context is now required to add and remove cohort
  members both in web UI and external API.
* There is a new CONTEXT_COHORT context level which allows delegation of moodle/cohort:manage
  and moodle/cohort:assign permissions for individual cohorts. The cohort visibility logic
  was not changed, moodle/cohort:view is still applicable at system, category and course levels.

  by not passing any parameters
